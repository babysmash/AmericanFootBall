However, it wasn't until the 1880s that a great rugby player from Yale, Walter Camp, pioneered rules changes that slowly transformed rugby into the new game of American Football.

Competition was heated and each club vowed to stock its teams with the best players available. Toward this end, some clubs obtained jobs for star players.

Not many people, however, know the details about who Heffelfinger was as a person. William Walter Heffelfinger was born on Dec. 20, 1867 in Minneapolis. Minn. His father was in the shoemaking business and dabbled in real estate.  'Pudge' played baseball and football at Central High School in Minneapolis before he matriculated to Yale University and attended the school from 1888 to 1891. His exceptional and natural athletic ability earned him legendary status while at Yale. Playing on both the offensive and defensive lines, Heffelfinger was named to Walter Camp’s All-American Team three times. Yale was a major football power during that time as Heffelfinger helped lead the team to undefeated seasons in 1888 and ’91 along with one-loss seasons in 1889 and 1890. The 1888 team amazingly outscored their opponents 698-0 that season (see table to right).While the PAC had suspected something illegal was afoot, there was no immediate evidence to back up its belief that the AAA had abandoned the standard practices of the day by actually paying someone to play football. Absolute verification, in fact, did not become public for almost 80 years until the Pro Football Hall of Fame received and displayed a document – an expense accounting sheet of the Allegheny Athletic Association that clearly shows a game performance bonus to W. Heffelfinger for playing (cash) $500. While it is possible that others were paid to play before 1892, the AAA expense sheet provides the first irrefutable evidence of an out-and-out cash payment. It is appropriately referred to today as pro football's birth certificate.

Heffelfinger, who had been a three-time Yale All-America guard in 1889, 1890 and 1891, had been granted a leave of absence from his job as a low-salaried railroad office employee in Omaha so he could accompany the Chicago team on a six-game tour of the East. The PAC, with a particular sense of urgency after its star Kirschner had been sidelined with an injury, scouted Chicago in a tour-opener against the Cleveland Athletic Association. Chicago won easily and Heffelfinger had an outstanding game. The Pittsburgh Press on October 30, 1892 reported that Heffelfinger and Knowlton 'Snake' Ames of the Chicago team had been offered $250 to play for the PAC against the Allegheny Athletic Association in the upcoming November 12 game. Thus alerted, the AAA did some scouting of its own and found that Ben 'Sport' Donnelly, a star end, and Ed Malley would play with the AAA for the usual 'double expense money.' Ames was unwilling to risk his amateur standing for any price and Heffelfinger said only he couldn't risk his amateur status for a mere $250. In effect, pro football had its first 'holdout' even before it had its first pro. When the AAA representatives learned that Heffelfinger would play for $500, they readily welcomed him into the fold. When the teams took the field on November 12, PAC players quickly noticed that Heffelfinger, Donnelly and Malley were in AAA uniforms. The PAC coach took his team off the field because, among several reasons, followers of both sides had bet heavily on the game and the AAA obviously had tilted the scale with ringers. Finally, it was agreed that game would be played as an exhibition and that all bets would be off. The lengthy bickering had delayed the kickoff so long that the game had to be shortened to two 30-minute halves (instead of 45 minutes) to beat the autumn darkness soon to descend on Pittsburgh. Midway through the first half, Heffelfinger scored the game's only touchdown when he forced a fumble, recovered it, and raced 25 yards for a score. Touchdowns counted four points in 1892, so Allegheny won 4-0. Almost no one was happy with the result. AAA fans were angry because they were unable to collect on their bets. PAC followers were furious over the use of the Chicago players and charged that Heffelfinger had actually been paid cash to play. The AAA manager O.D. Thompson insisted he had acted prudently and had merely done 'what the Pittsburghs tried to do. Only we were successful where they failed.' It should be noted that the expense accounting sheet that years later proved the PAC charges to be correct was signed by none other than O.D. Thompson. That now-famous Allegheny Athletic Association expense sheet also showed that the AAA realized a net profit of $621 for the game, despite the 'huge' payment to Heffelfinger. Since winning and maintaining financial solvency were dual objectives in 1892 just as they are today, the AAA's first venture into pro football had proved satisfactory, both on and off the field.\n\n","content"]]
